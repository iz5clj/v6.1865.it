<p>This is our only Junior Suite. Measuring 43 square metres, it is dedicated to the great American author who lived in Florence for long periods, at the time when it was the capital of Italy and where he set parts of his novel "The Portrait of a Lady" (which is also a famous movie).</p>
<p>This is our most classic room. Decorated in neutral tones, it overlooks an internal garden. The walls are painted in the exclusive House White shade made by Farrow & Ball, and harmonises to perfection with the tones of the frescoed ceiling. The furniture is in antique walnut and the cream curtains are of silk.</p>
<p>The bathroom has a large window and has a separate WC, as used to be the custom. The bathtub is in cast iron and the shower compartment is in travertine.</p>
