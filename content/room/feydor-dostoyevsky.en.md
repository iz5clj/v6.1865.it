<p>Dedicated to this great Russian novelist, who lived in Florence between 1869 and 1870 and where he finished his novel "The Idiot", this is the most theatrical and opulent of our rooms.'</p>
<p>Its large window overlooks a residential street. The colours are a combination of eggplant and antique rose, to echo the beautiful fresco on the ceiling. The curtains are of linen and damask velvet, and the furniture is a mix of design and antique pieces.</p>
<p>The travertine bathroom has a separate shower.</p>
