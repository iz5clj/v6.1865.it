review_title: "Exceeded already high expectations.Superb!"
review_text: "Our expectations were high after reading so many glowing reviews. I am happy to say that our stay at 1865 Residenza d'epoca was the highlight of our trip. It has the feel of a private club. My sister and I were checked in by Michel, our wonderful host. Michel gave us a tour of the property and gave us our room keys. My room was Jessie White Mario. The room has a beautiful frescoed ceiling and a view of the garden. Everything has been thought of, from blackout drapes to multiple outlets for charging electronic devices. The king size bed is comfortable and features high thread count linens. The climate control unit has precise settings. It was just warm enough for me to leave the window open and enjoy the quiet. No honking horns, etc. The Jessie White Mario bathroom has plenty of room. The rainfall shower head is a plus. Toiletries include shampoo, shower gel, lotion, and a small amenity kit. My sister's room was Karl Hillebrand. The room is finished in a mocha brown color and overlooks the garden. Behind the bed and its giant headboard is a custom made closet/dresser area. It's quite nice. The bathroom has a massive walk in shower. The moment my sister saw the bathroom, she wanted this room. Both our rooms were spotlessly clean. Extra amenities include slippers and a room safe. The dining room has an extra refrigerator for guests to store food. Wifi speeds were 15 Mbps down and 6 Mbps up. Small snacks such as fruit and biscotti are available in the living room. Breakfast was great throughout our stay. Michel and Cinzia make the most wonderful scrambled eggs for breakfast, any way you like them. The breakfast/dining room also features very comfortable couches and chairs to relax and socialize. Calm piano music usually play in the background. Our hosts, Michel and Cinzia were wonderful. I recommend that anyone looking to visit Florence book their rooms well in advance."

<p>Dedicated to this historian and essayist who was German by birth but French by adoption. Hillebrand lived in Florence during the period following the unification of Italy, where he worked as a correspondent for numerous international publications, including the "Times".</p>
<p>This is a very intimate room in warm tones of cream and chocolate, and furnished with surprising, specially made design pieces. It overlooks an internal garden and has a view of the beautiful Synagogue, built in 1882. The travertine bathroom, with its large shower, is particularly spacious and innovative. Ideal for a single person.</p>
