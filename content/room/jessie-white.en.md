<p>Dedicated to a courageous female British author and journalist who took an active part in Garibaldi's most important campaigns, and who lived in Florence in the period following the unification of Italy.</p>
<p>This is a spacious room that guarantees complete privacy; its pearl grey and bronze tones harmonise with the romantic fresco on the ceiling, which we discovered during the restoration work.</p>
<p>The bedroom and bathroom both overlook a lovely nineteenth-century private garden. The furnishings, which were designed and made to measure, are elegant and understated.</p>
