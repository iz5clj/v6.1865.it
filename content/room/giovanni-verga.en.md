review_title: "A charming place to stay"
review_text: "This perfectly located B& B is wonderful place to stay for a few days while exploring the city of Florence. It's situated a a short walk to the main sites of the city, which means it's away from the hustle and bustle and quiet in the evening. The rooms are large, airy and spotlessly clean and with a fresco on the ceiling what more could you want! Michele and his son provide an excellent breakfast with a range of cheeses, meats and fruit, as well as eggs made to order. The coffee machine takes a little getting to used to but provides an excellent brew. This is a charming place to stay."

<p>Dedicated to this famous Sicilian author who lived in Florence in 1869, where he set his novel "Eva". To be exact, he set it in the streets between Piazza d'Azeglio and the Teatro della Pergola.</p>
<p> This bright, fresh room decorated in Mediterranean colours, with its ceiling fresco representing the dawn, overlooks a residential street. Local craftsmen made the furniture from original designs, and the curtains are of pure linen.</p>
<p>The very large travertine bathroom has a <strong>spectacular</strong> shower.</p>
